For smaller alphabets, another scheme is used. But $\sqrt{\lg n}$ is already pretty small, so instead of implementing a whole other scheme just in order to skip $1$ or $2$ levels, we just travel normally until we find a level containing jumps with a $\Sigma \geq \sqrt{\lg n}$ \todo{Eller $\Sigma \geq \lg^\epsilon n$}. This should not have a big impact. \todo{rephrase}
