\section{Simplified Range Searching}

This section will introduce the primary work of the thesis. \todo{this thesis eller the thesis?} It will show how the SRS data structure is built and how range reporting is done using the data structure. The data structure uses $\mathcal{O}(n)$ space and supports search queries in $\mathcal{O}(\lg n + k\cdot \lg^\epsilon n)$ time. This is the same space complexity as the kd-tree. The query time is different in that $\lg n$ is smaller than $\sqrt{n}$, but there now is a penalty of $\mathcal{O}(\lg^\epsilon n)$ per point reported. Succint rank queries are an important part of this chapter, playing a key role in solving the ball-inheritance problem. 


\subsection{Preliminaries}

\subsubsection{Predecessor search using binary search}
In order to find the rank space successor or rank space predecessor of a point, a binary search is used on a sorted array of points. This data structure uses $\mathcal{O}(n)$ space and have a query time of $\mathcal{O}(\lg n)$. By locating the first key in the array that is greater than or equal to the search query, the index of that key is the rank space successor. Similarly, by locating the last key that is smaller in the array, the index of that key is the ranks space predecessor.

\subsubsection{Succint rank queries}
Consider an array $A[1..n]$ with elements from some alphabet $\Sigma$. Given an index $i$ in the array, we can find out how many elements in $A[1..i]$ are equal to $A[i]$. This is called a \emph{rank query}. We want to be able to answer the rank query in constant time using a data structure of $\mathcal{O}(n \lg \Sigma)$ bits. In order to do this, checkpoints are created. For each character in the alphabet $\Sigma$, the checkpoint contains the number of times that character appears in $A[1..i]$, where $i$ is the checkpoint location. Such a checkpoint takes up $\mathcal{O}(\Sigma \lg n)$ bits of space. By placing each checkpoint $\Sigma \lg n$ entries apart of each other, all of the checkpoints use $\mathcal{O}(\frac{n}{\Sigma \lg n} \cdot \Sigma \lg n) = \mathcal{O}(n)$ bits of space.

Furthermore, for each entry in the array $A$, a smaller sum will be stored. Each entry in $A$ contains a character from the alphabet $\Sigma$. At $A[i]$ we store the amount of times the character at $A[i]$ appears since the last checkpoint. This is a smaller number and can be stored using $\mathcal{O}(\lg (\Sigma \lg n))$ bits per entry in $A$. This is because we only need $\lg x$ bits to store a number which has a maximum value of $x-1$. Since there is only $\Sigma \lg n$ entries between each checkpoint, this adds up. This approach fits the required space bound if $\Sigma \geq \sqrt{\lg n}$ \todo{replace $\sqrt{\lg n}$ with $\lg^\epsilon n$}, because there $\Sigma$ will dominate the complexity. 

For smaller alphabets, another scheme is used. Checkpoinst are still stored at every $\Sigma \lg n$ positions. In addition to this, minor checkpoints are added. These minor checkpoints are added at every $\lg \lg n$ positions and contain the amount of times each character is seen since the last major checkpoint. These minor checkpoints take up $\mathcal{O}(\Sigma \lg \lg n)$ bits each. In order to answer the rank query, a query to the last major checkpoint and the last minor checkpoint has to be made. Given that $\Sigma \lg \lg n \leq \sqrt{\lg n} \cdot \lg \lg n$, the array entries holding the amount of times $A[i]$ is seen since the last minor checkpoint fits into $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\lg n} \cdot \lg^2 \lg n)$ bits. Therefore it is possible to store these array entries in plain form, and with the help of a precomputed table of $n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ space we can answer rank queries between minor checkpoints in constant time. \todo{Plain form?} \todo{rephrase} \todo{Maybe only need large alphabet +  bit vector. Then can leave out complicated multilevel}


\subsection{Solving the ball-inheritance problem} 
\label{ssection:solving-ball}

Consider a perfect binary tree with $n$ leaves. At each level a bit vector $A[1..n]$ is used to indicate which of a node's children a ball is inherited by: If $A[i]$ is $0$ it means that the ball with identity $i$ in that node was inherited by its left child and $1$ means that it was inherited by its right child. Given a node $v$ and an identity of a ball, we can now calculate the ball's identity in the child node which inherits the ball. The node can answer the query $rank_v(k) = \Sigma_{i \leq k} A[i]$. If a ball is inherited by the right child node its new identity at that node is $rank_v(i)$ because that is how many $1$'s that preceed it in the current node. If a ball is inherited by the left child node the new identity is then $i-rank_v(i)$. With this information it is possible to traverse down the tree following a ball from any given node to a leaf. There are $n$ balls per level which is represented by a bit vector of size $n$ bits per level. Even though conceptually this bit vector is divided out amongst the nodes of that level, we can interchangebly think of it as a bit vector per level or a bit vector per node. Each level in the tree uses $\mathcal{O}(n)$ bits to store the bit vectors. This adds up to $\mathcal{O}(n \lg n)$ bits, or $\mathcal{O}(n)$ words in all. This trivial solution to the ball-inheritance problem uses $\mathcal{O}(\lg n)$ query time, given that it follows a ball $\mathcal{O}(\lg n)$ steps down to its leaf. The rank function is a constant time query.\todo{henvis til prelim}. \\


A bit vector is an array with entries from the alphabet $\Sigma = \{0,1\}$, where each entry is used to indicate whether a left or right child has been chosen to inherit a given ball. By expanding the alphabet we can point to the children's children, $\Sigma = \{0,1,2,3\}$, the children's children's children, $\Sigma = \{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7\}$, and so forth. Expanding the alphabet will use $\mathcal{O}(n \lg \Sigma)$ bits per level. Storing a pointer from level $i$ to level $i+\Delta$ increases the storage space by $\Delta$ bits per ball, but also enables the ball to be inherited by $2^\Delta$ descendants. By expanding the alphabet the query time can be lowered since it is possible to take bigger steps down the tree. 

Using this concept, we pick $B$ such that $2 \leq B \leq m$, where $m$ is the height of the tree. All levels that are a multiple of $B^i$ expand their alphabet such that the balls reach $B^i$ levels down. If a target level does not exist, the ball points to its leaf. We need at most visit $B$ levels that are multiple of $B^i$ before reaching a level that is multiple of $B^{i+1}$, making it possible to jump down the tree with bigger and bigger steps.

Storing the expanded alphabets at each level that is multiple of $B^i$ costs $B^i$ bits per ball. The total cost is then $\Sigma^{\lg_B \lg n}_i \frac{\lg n}{B^i} \cdot \mathcal{O}(B^i) = \mathcal{O}(\lg n \cdot \lg_B \lg n)$ bits per ball, at all levels. With $n$ balls, this is $\mathcal{O}(n \lg_B \lg n)$ words of space with query time of $\mathcal{O}(B \lg_B \lg n)$. If we pick a $B \leq \lg^\epsilon n$ we can reduce $\lg_B \lg n$ to $\lg_{\lg^\epsilon n} \lg n = \frac{1}{\epsilon}$. Thus, the time complexity for solving the ball-inheritance is $\mathcal{O}(\lg^\epsilon n)$. \todo{Det er fordi $\lg_B \lg n$ er det st√∏rste $i$ som beskriver $B^i \leq \lg n$ }



\subsection{Solving range reporting}

Consider a perfect binary tree with $n$ leaves. The root contains $n$ points in $2$-d rank space. Recall that when distributing points in a binary tree, the words \emph{ball} and \emph{point} can be used interchangeably. These $n$ balls at the root of the tree are sorted by their y-rank. When distributing the balls for inheritance, a node will give both its children half of its balls: the lower half sorted by the x-rank to its left child and the upper half by x-rank to its right child. The order of the balls in a child node will be the same as the parent node. The actual coordinates of the balls are only stored at the leaves. This is how the ball-inheritance data structure was described in the previous section. The ball distribution has been specified. With this distribution, some facts about the tree can be stated. We know that the x-coordinates of the balls in the leaves are sorted from left to right - smallest to highest. The way the balls are distributed from the root, the x-coordinates are responsible for the inheritance path. \todo{rephrase} Because the nodes are sorted by their y-rank in the root node and that they keep this order, the balls in a node list at any given node is ordered by their y-rank. These two facts will be used to solve the range reporting.

Since the actual coordinates of the points are only stored once, this data structure uses linear space. \\

Given a range query $q = [x_1, x_2] \times [y_1, y_2]$ the rank successors of $x_1$ and $y_1$ and the rank predecessors of $x_2$ and $y_2$ are looked up. We know from section \todo{ref} that a range query can be translated to a rank space query. We call these $\hat{x}_1, \hat{y}_1, \hat{x}_2$ and $\hat{y}_2$. We now have our query $q$ in rank space: $\hat{q} = [\hat{x_1}, \hat{x_2}] \times [\hat{y_1}, \hat{y_2}]$. We use $\hat{x}_1$ and $\hat{x}_2$ to find the lowest common ancestor, $LCA(\hat{x}_1, \hat{x}_2)$. This node's subtree contains at least all the points with an x-coordinate between $x_1$ and $x_2$. \\

At the root we mark the positions of $\hat{y}_1$ and $\hat{y}_2$ on the bit vector. This range indicates which balls lie within the range of $[y_1, y_2]$. Going forward we will use $i_v$ and $j_v$ to indicate this range in the bit vector of the node $v$. When searching for points lying within this range, a node will update this range to fit its children. The new updated range at the left child $l$ will be $i_l = i_v - rank_v(i_v)$ and $j_l = j_v - rank_v(j_v)$. The new updated range at the right child $r$ will be $i_r = rank_v(i_v)$ and $j_r = rank_v(j_v)$. This is the same way the rank query was used in section \ref{ssection:solving-ball}. Now instead of just following a given ball, we keep track of a range of balls. \\

Traversing from the root to the $LCA$, this y-range will be updated accordingly. We know the positions of the leaves containing $\hat{x}_1$ and $\hat{x}_2$ so we can traverse from the $LCA$ down to each of them. Traversing to $\hat{x}_1$, the first stop is the left child of the $LCA$. From here, each time a node selects its left child as the path to $\hat{x}_1$ we know that the subtree contained in the right child only contains points between $x_1$ and $x_2$. Symmetrically, the same applies when going right from the $LCA$: Each time a node selects a right child on the path to $\hat{x}_2$ the subtree contained in the left child only contains points between $x_1$ and $x_2$. Such a subtree is said to be fully contained. This concept is seen on figure \ref{fig:LCA}. \\

Each time a fully contained subtree is found, we want to follow all the balls lying in the y-range of the root of the subtree to their leaves. This is exactly what the ball-inheritance solves: We are given a list of ball identities and want to find their actualy coordinates. Finding a ball's coordinate from here takes $\mathcal{O}(\lg^\epsilon n)$ time per ball.

    \label{fig:bitvectorsplit}
\end{figure}


%The data structure is utilized as follows:
%\begin{enumerate}
%    \item Use a binary seach to find the rank space predecessors and successors of $x_1$, $y_1$, $x_2$ and $y_2$. At this point the algorithm will terminate if either rank space range is empty.
%    \item From $LCA(\hat{x}_1, \hat{x}_2)$, both $\hat{x}_1$ and $\hat{x}_2$ will be visited. The range y-rank range found in step $1$ will be updated from the root to this $LCA$ and updated from the $LCA$ to $\hat{x}_1$, $\hat{x}_2$ and all the subtrees between them.
%    \item Each time a fully included subtree is visited, we determine which balls falls within the y-range and use the ball-inheritance structure to travel to its leaf. When a leaf is visited, its actual coordinates will be reported back as a result.
%\end{enumerate}

The actual coordinates of the points are only stored at the leaves which then takes up $\mathcal{O}(n)$  words of space. The rest of the tree contains $\lg n$ levels of bit vectors of $n$ bits taking $\mathcal{O}(n \lg n)$ bits, $\mathcal{O}(n)$ words. Looking up the rank-space predecessor and successor of $x_1, x_2, y_1$ and $y_2$ using a simple binary search at the root requires $\mathcal{O}(n)$ space and $\mathcal{O}(\lg n)$ time. Summing it up, the entire data structure uses $\mathcal{O}(n)$ words of space. 

Walking from the root to the $LCA$ requires $\mathcal{O}(\lg n)$ steps. Visiting $\hat{x}_1$ and $\hat{x}_2$ requires $\mathcal{O}(\lg n)$ steps each. Visiting each of the $k$ leaves in the subtrees between $\hat{x}_1$ and $\hat{x}_2$ ,containing the points which will be reported as a result, takes $\mathcal{O}(k \cdot \lg^\epsilon n)$ time.

This adds up to $\mathcal{O}(\lg n + (1+k)\cdot\lg^\epsilon n)$ query time to report $k$ points as results. An empty range can be detected by the binary search at the root. There might not be any points with an x-coordinate in $[x_1, x_2]$ or any points with an y-coordinate in $[y_1, y_2]$. If the binary search does not report an empty range, we proceed with the search. \todo{Forklar hvordan $\lg^\epsilon n$ opst√•r fra ``solving ball-inheritance}

\section{Orthogonal Range Searching}
\label{sect:original}

This section describes the ORS data structure by \citet{chanetal}. While the theoretical work of this thesis is a simplification of this data structure, the ORS can also be viewed as an extension \todo{Rigtige ord?} of the SRS. The ORS data structure will not implemented, but serves as a theoretical background for the SRS.

Utilizing the ball-inheritance structure, \citet{chanetal} propose a better solution for orthogonal range search queries. Theorem $2.1$ states that \emph{for any $2 \leq B \leq \lg^\epsilon n$, we can can solve $2$-d orthogonal range reporting in rank space with $\mathcal{O}(n \lg_B \lg n)$ space and $(1+k)\mathcal{O}(B \lg \lg n)$ query time.}

In this section some supporting data structures will be introduced. Then we will show how the ball-inheritance is used in conjunction with these data structures to find the points within a search query $q = [x_1, x_2] \times [y_1, y_2]$.

\subsection{Preliminaries}

\subsubsection{Range minimum queries}
In order to find the smallest element in a range, a succint data structure will be used. This data structure can solve the \emph{range minimum query} problem and will be refered to as RMQ. 
Consider an array $A$ with $n$ comparable keys, this succint data structure allows finding the index of the minimum key in the subarray $A[i,j]$. \citet{fischer} introduces a data structure which solves this problem in $2n + \mathcal{O}(n)$ bits of space with constant query time. The construction requires that the array is ordered, which we will see fits into our scheme.

\subsubsection{Rank space predessecor search}
In order to look up the rank space predecessor of a given coordinate, another succint data structure will be used. This data structure has a smaller space complexity than the RMQ, but has a bigger query time.
Given a sorted array $A[1..n]$ of $\omega$-bit integers, predecessor search queries in $\mathcal{O}(\lg \omega)$ time is supported using $\mathcal{O}(n \lg \omega)$ bits of space which has oracle access to the entries in the array. \todo{reference}. 

\subsection{Solving range reporting}
With a solution to the ball-inheritance problem, \citet{chanetal} proposes \textbf{Lemma 2.4} \emph{if the ball inheritance problem can be solved with space $S$ and query time $\tau$, $2$-d range reporting can be solved with space $\mathcal{O}(S+n)$ and query time $\mathcal{O}(\lg \lg n + (1+k) \tau)$.} \\


The ball distribution scheme of this data structure is the same as the simplified range search of section \ref{ssection:solving-ball}. Having distributed the $n$ points from the root to the leaves, additional data structures are required in order to answer the range queries. For each node in the tree that is a right child a range minimum query structure is added. The indices are the y-rank and the keys are the x-rank that the given node contains. A range maximum query structure is added to the all the nodes which are left children. Each data structure uses $2n + \mathcal{O}(n)$ bits, making it $\mathcal{O}(n)$ bits per level of the tree and $\mathcal{O}(n \lg n)$ bits in all - i.e. $\mathcal{O}(n)$ words of space. \\

In order to support predecessor (and successor) search for the y-rank in the data structure, the rank space predecessor search data structure is added to the tree. This data structure works on an array of the y-ranks, which is already sorted. The points in rank space of $\mathcal{O}(\lg n)$ bits will use $\mathcal{O}(n \lg \lg n)$ bits per level, with $\omega = \lg n$, and $\mathcal{O}(n \lg n \lg \lg n)$ bits in all, which is $\mathcal{O}(n \lg \lg n)$ words. In order to reduce this to linear space we will only place this predecessor search structure at levels which are multiples of $\lg \lg n$. When using the predecessor search from the lowest common ancestor of $\hat{x}_1$ and $\hat{x}_2$, $LCA(\hat{x}_1, \hat{x}_2)$, we go up to the closest ancestor node which has a predecessor structure in order to perform the search there. Searching takes $\mathcal{O}(\lg \lg n)$ time plus $\mathcal{O}(1)$ queries to the ball-inheritance structure. Using the ball-inheritance structure we walk at most $\lg \lg n$ steps down while translating the ranks of $y_1$ and $y_2$ to the right and left child of $LCA(\hat{x}_1, \hat{x}_2)$. 

The reason why this structure is necessary for the y-ranks and not the x-ranks, is because of the way the points have been distributed in the ball-inheritance tree: From left to right, the leaves have x-rank $1,2,..n$ so we can easily locate a given range in x-dimension, but in order to keep track of the y-dimensional range we need to follow the balls down the ball-inheritance structure. Adding this structure to each $\lg \lg n$ level saves us from going all the way from the root down to the $LCA$. \\

In order to use this data structure to report points in the range of $q = [x_1, x_2] \times [y_1, y_2]$ we follow these steps:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item We find the rank space successor of $x_1$, $\hat{x}_1$, and the rank space predecessor of $x_2$, $\hat{x}_2$. We use these to find the lowest common ancestor of $\hat{x}_1$ and $\hat{x}_2$, $LCA(\hat{x}_1, \hat{x}_2)$. This is the lowest node in the tree whose subtree contains at least all the points between $x_1$ and $x_2$. By knowing $\hat{x}_1$ and $\hat{x}_2$, finding the lowest common ancestor is a constant time operation. Using $(\hat{x}_1 \oplus \hat{x}_2)$ we are able to easily locate the position of the LCA: The number of leading zero bits describes the level of the node. The same amount of bits of $\hat{x}_1$ (or $\hat{x}_2$) describe the identity (from the left) of the node on that level. \todo{Skal jeg forklare hvorfor det virker - at $\hat{x}_1$ egentlig beskriver turen fra roden ned til bladet?}
  \item As in step $1$ where we found the rank space of the x-coordinates, we find the rank space coordinates of the y-coordinates, $\hat{y}_1$ and $\hat{y}_2$, inside the left and right child of $LCA(\hat{x}_1, \hat{x}_2)$. This step is precisely what the rank space predecessor structure mentioned above supports.
  \item We now descend into the right child of $LCA(\hat{x}_1, \hat{x}_2)$ and use the range minimum query structure to the find the index $m$ (the y-rank) of the point with the smallest x-rank in the range $[\hat{y}_1, \hat{y}_2]$. The y-rank of a point at a node is exactly the identity of the ball going to the leaf storing the point. Knowing the identity of the ball we can use the ball-inheritance structure to follow the path to the leaf to find the actual x-coordinate of the point. If the x-coordinate is smaller than $x_2$ we return the point as a result and recurse into the ranges of $[\hat{y}_1, m-1]$ and $[m+1, \hat{y}_2]$ in order to find more points. When this is done we apply the same concept to the left child of $LCA(\hat{y}_1, \hat{x}_2)$ using the range maximum query to find points above $x_1$.
\end{enumerate}

\todo{Insert figure to conceptually show we are working our way out from the inside}

The time complexity of step $3$ depends on the use of the ball-inheritance structure. The time to traverse this structure is dependent on the improvements made in \ref{ssection:solving-ball}. An empty range will result in two queries, one query to each child of $LCA(\hat{x}_1, \hat{x}_2)$. In the worst case the amount of queries to the ball-inheritance structure will be twice the number of results reported plus one. Each time a result is found, a recursion is made to both the left and right subrange of that result. If one of the sides constantly fails to find a result, at most two queries are made for each result found. For the final result found, two ranges are recursed into which reports no results.

Conceptually, $LCA(\hat{x}_1, \hat{x}_2)$ describes a point between $x_1$ and $x_2$. Step $3$ selects points that are in the range of $[y_1, y_2]$ moving outwards from the point of $LCA(\hat{x}_1, \hat{x}_2)$, always picking the point closest to $LCA(\hat{x}_1, \hat{x}_2)$ in its decreasing y-range. \todo{rephrase}

Going back to Lemma $2.4$, we see that the time complexity fits: $\mathcal{O}(\lg \lg n)$ time is used for the predecessor search and $\mathcal{O}((1+k)\tau)$ time is used for walking from the children of the $LCA$ to the leaves solving the ball inheritance problem for the $k$ results.

\section{Summary}

The four approaches described above all use a number of words linear to the amount of points. Theoretically, the ORS by \citet{chanetal} with its $\mathcal{O}(\lg \lg n + (1+k)(\lg^\epsilon n))$ query time is faster than the SRS. The kd-tree has no time penalty per point reported, while both the ORS and the SRS has a time penalty of $\mathcal{O}(\lg^\epsilon n)$ per point reported. The $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n})$ in the kd-tree query time comes from the rather pessimistic view that a search region intersects the entire region of one of the children of the root node \todo{m√¶rkelig s√¶tning}, but does not fully contain any smaller region. Thus, the query time of the kd-tree is very reliant on how the search region intersects with the subdivived regions in the kd-tree. The query time of the kd-tree can therefore vary a lot, while the query time of the SRS will be more stable. While $n$ grows, $\sqrt{n}$ grows at a much bigger rate than $\lg n$. There will be cases the kd-tree is better than the SRS and vice versa. \todo{Eksempler - alle punkter inkluderet og en meget tynd streg igennem}
