First and foremost, I would like to thank for advisoer, Kasper Green Larsen. He gave me the idea for my thesis, and he has been extremely helpful and engaged in the process of my writing. It has been a pleasure to work with Kasper.
I would also like to thank Eva Frederiksen for creating figures for chapters $1$, $2$ and $3$. It obviously helps a lot when the figures make sense. Johan Abildskov was kind enough to read an early draft of my thesis and give me some very good feedback.

Some of the figures are inspired by the figures in \todo{ref comp geo bog}
