This thesis studies orthogonal range searching which is one of the most well-studied problems in computational geometry. We introduce the Ball Inheritance Search data structure. This data structure requires $\mathcal{O}(n)$ space and can return $k$ points with a query time of $\mathcal{O}(\lg n + k\cdot\lg^\epsilon n)$ for any fixed constant $\epsilon > 0$. We compare the Ball Inheritance Search data structure to the kd-tree. The kd-tree requires $\mathcal{O}(n)$ space and can return $k$ points with a query time of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n} + k)$.\\

We compare the query time of the two data structures with queries of different shapes. We show that both data structure have both best-case and worst-case shapes for their queries, and given a search query of their best-case shape they perform better than their counterpart.\\

Finally we look at a small amount of results. A search query of the worst-case shape to the Ball Inheritance Search data structure does not perform that much worse than the best-case shape to the kd-tree, while a search query of the best-case shape the Ball Inheritance Search performs much better than a search query of the worst-case shape to the kd-tree. The difference between the best-case and worst-case shape is least on the Ball Inheritance Search data structure, and thus it has a more stable performance.



\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgments}

First and foremost, I would like to thank for advisor, Kasper Green Larsen. He shared his idea for a thesis with me, and he has been extremely helpful and engaged in the process of my writing. It has been a pleasure to work with Kasper.
I would also like to thank Eva Frederiksen for creating figures for chapters $1$, $2$ and $3$. It obviously helps a lot when the figures make sense. Johan Abildskov was kind enough to read an early draft of my thesis and give me some very good feedback.\\

Some of the figures are inspired by the figures in \todo{ref comp geo bog}
