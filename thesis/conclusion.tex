In this thesis we have presented the theory and performance of the BIS data structure. We have compared the performance of the BIS data structure to that of the kd-tree. The BIS data structure gives a stable performance which is corresponds rather well the theoretical running time of $\mathcal{O}(\lg n + k\cdot\lg^\epsilon n)$. It does not seem like the theoretical query time has any hidden big constants like we assumed the OBIS data structure had.

We have seen that just like the kd-tree, that the BIS data structure has a worst-case search query and a best-case search query. The difference between the worst-case and best-case search query to the BIS data structure is much less than that of the kd-tree. We have seen that the search query to the BIS data structure performs much more stable than a search query to the kd-tree.

Given a search query in the shape of slice, the BIS data structure will outperform the kd-tree up to good size. With $2^{17}$ points and a vertical search query, the BIS data structure will outperform the kd-tree when the result is less than $200$. With $2^{25}$ points and a vertical search query, the BIS data structure will outperform the kd-tree with the result is less than $4660$. For smaller sizes of $k$, a vertical query to the BIS data structure will be several times faster than the kd-tree. With $2^{17}$ points and a vertical search query, the BIS data structure will be $3.5$ times faster than the kd-tree when $k = 50$. With $2^{25}$ points the BIS data structure will be $42$ times faster than the kd-tree when $k = 50$. 

There is a duality between the shapes of the search queries to the BIS data structure and the kd-tree. The BIS data structure performed best with slices and the kd-tree performed best with square searches. The BIS data structure performs worst with the square search and the kd-tree performs worst with a slice.

We have seen that the BIS data structure actually does compete with the kd-tree. The BIS data structure could be a realistic alternative to the kd-tree in actual practice. By picking an $\epsilon$ and a $c$ for $B = c\cdot\lg^\epsilon n$ we are able to leverage the performance of the BIS data structure with the amount of main memory it should be able to use.

The experiments show that the BIS data structure is a good competitor to the kd-tree and uses far less space than the range tree.
